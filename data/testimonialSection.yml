    comment: "It is my pleasure to proudly recommend Francesc Montané for a data science position. 

My name is Matt Dancho, Founder of Business Science and Lead Educator at Business Science University. I had the pleasure of working with Francesc over the past 6-months as part of an accelerated data science program that has focused on applying data science to business.

Francesc has shown a high aptitude for data science, which has been demonstrated in the two independent projects that he successfully completed as part of our program.

The first independent project is a stock analysis and forecasting application that has demonstrated the use of several high-performance tools including R Shiny, Modeltime (Forecasting) and Timetk (Time Series Analysis).

The second application is a medical insurance cost prediction application that predicts medical costs between smokers and nonsmokers. The application uses R Shiny and Machine Learning to make cost predictions based on user inputs such as Smoker (Y/N), BMI, Age, etc.

I am confident that Francesc will be an excellent fit for data science positions that involve challenging business problems and a desire to make better business decisions. 

Feel free to contact me at mdancho@business-science.io if you have any questions or would like me to further discuss Francesc’s achievements."
